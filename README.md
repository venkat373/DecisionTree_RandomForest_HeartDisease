Heart Disease Prediction: Decision Tree & Random Forest

 Objective
This project trains and evaluates Decision Tree and Random Forest models on the Heart Disease dataset.  
It compares performance, analyzes overfitting, and interprets feature importance.

 Files in Repo
- `heart.csv` → Dataset used  
- `heart_analysis.ipynb` → Jupyter Notebook with full workflow  
- `screenshots/` → Visualizations (Decision Tree, feature importance, etc.)  
- `README.md` → Project summary  
Steps Performed
1. Loaded and explored dataset (`heart.csv`)  
2. Trained a **Decision Tree Classifier**  
   - Visualized the tree  
   - Analyzed overfitting using `max_depth`  
3. Trained a **Random Forest Classifier**  
   - Compared accuracy with Decision Tree  
   - Interpreted **feature importances**  
4. Evaluated both models using **cross-validation**  

 Results
- **Decision Tree Accuracy:** ~XX%  
- **Random Forest Accuracy:** ~YY%  
- Random Forest showed higher generalization ability.  

Libraries Used
- pandas, numpy  
- matplotlib, seaborn  
- scikit-learn
